## Description
This application downloads a file from the internet using `Download Manager`,  
saves the file to the user's `External Storage Public Directory`, and sends  
the user a `Notification` after completion. The download button provided on the  
Main screen is a `Custom Button` extending the `View` class which animates both  
horizontally and in a center-filled arc while the file downloads. Once completed,  
users can click on the notification content to navigate directly to their `Downloads`  
directory, or the notification's `Action Button` to navigate to a Details screen with  
animated views via `MotionLayout` that provides the downloaded file's name, final  
download status, and a return to Main screen button.

## Inspiration
Basic concept & photos provided by ***Udacity's Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree*** course

## Features
- `Permission Request Codes` managed by the OS system via `Androidx.Activity` library
    - > **IMPORTANT**  
      > Permissions need to be granted in order for the app to run as intended
- `Intent Activities` driven by user decisions within Dialogs & Notifications
- `API` level checks which differentiate application functionality & permission dialogs
    - `Android 8.0 (Level 26) & Above` - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission handling
    - `Former Releases` - `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission handling
- A `Material 3 Design` Component, `Radio Buttons`, allowing users to select pre-linked files
    - An `Edit Text View` dialog that allows users to enter their own download `URL` 
- `Multi-threading` to allow `UI` animations while concurrently running background `IO` tasks:
    1. Tries to create `/LOADAPP` directory in `/storage/emulated/0/Download`
        - `Success` - saves downloaded files to `/LOADAPP`
        - `Fail` - saves downloaded files to `/storage/emulated/0/Download`
    2. Opens a `HttpURLConnection` to retrieve a `Response Code` from any provided URL
        - `200 OK` - queues the request & downloads the file via Download Manager
        - `Other Responses` - displays the response code to the user via `Toast` message
    3. Handles anticipated `Exceptions` by displaying a `Toast` message to the user
        - `UnknownHostException` - "Unknown Host...Address Does Not Exist"
        - `MalformedURLException` - "Malformed URL...No DNS Protocol Exists"
        - `Other Exceptions` - Prints exception & message to console for future handling
- A `Custom Button` extending the View class in order to provide a custom style & animation
- Custom view `attributes` provided to `value animator`, `listener`, & a `.xml` animation
- An overridden `onDraw` method & `Painter` object to position & paint objects on the `Canvas`

## Installation
